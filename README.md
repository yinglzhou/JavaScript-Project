# JS Project

### Background:
_____ is a game that follows a young wizard in his journey to defeat evil enemies and restore peace to the wizarding world. The player starts out in the center of the map and can move around using their arrow keys. Enemies will spawn from entrance points on the sides of the map. The player can use their WASD keys to shoot bullets in the corresponding directions. The goal of each level is to stay alive until the time runs out. 


### Functionality & MVPs
Wizards will be able to:
- Move around with their arrow keys
- Shoot bullets in different directions with their WASD keys

### Wireframes
- The title/banner will display the name of the game. 
    - To the right of the title, there will be links to Github and LinkedIn.
- In the game screen, the player's spawn position is represented as the little man in the center. 
    - The possible spawn locations of enemies are represented with the little geo markers. 
    - The timer for every level will be displayed at the top right corner of the game screen. 
    - On the left of the timer, there will be little hearts indicating how many lives the player has.
- Towards the right, there will be a panel for basic instructions for movement and shooting. 

**(bonus)**
- There is also a scoreboard that I may use to count the amount of enemies that players have taken down. 

### Technologies, Libraries, APIs
The following technologies will be implemented:
- `Canvas API` for rendering the map, player, and enemies.
- `Webpack` for bundling and transpiling JavaScript Code.
- `npm` for managing dependencies
